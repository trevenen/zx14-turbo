That isn't good enough? 

Determine the required airflow in cubic feet of air per minute. Boost doesn't make power, it just shoves more air through your engine. Because engines typically operate an air/fuel ratio of about 14 parts air to 1 part fuel, and because gasoline contains a certain amount of energy (about 114,000 British Thermal Units per gallon), you can make a direct correlation between airflow in cfm and horsepower. That ratio is about 150 cfm to 100 horsepower. 

OEM Air Flow: 164.70 CFM
MAX Air Flow: 188.20 CFM


Divide your required airflow by your engine's stock airflow to determine the required boost pressure ratio (the ratio of boost pressure to atmospheric pressure, which is about 14.7 psi). 

OEM
164.70 / 191.7 = 0.85915492958

MAX
188.20 /  207.9 = 0.90524290524

Look through a manufacturer's selection of "turbo maps." A turbo map is a graph that indexes airflow to pressure ratio, and gives a visual representation of turbo efficiency at a given pressure ratio and cfm. You'll see pressure ratio on the vertical axis and the airflow on the horizontal axis. A compressor map looks something like an elongated bulls-eye: the center of that bull's eye is the compressor's maximum efficiency range, which is where it makes boost without producing excess heat.

Compare your engine's required pressure ratio and airflow in cfm to various compressor maps and find one that puts your target airflow/pressure point in the center-to-upper-right-hand corner of the compressor's maximum efficiency range (the center of the bulls-eye). Many times you'll find airflow expressed in the metric "m3/s," or meters cubed per second. To convert cfm to m3/s, multiply cfm by 0.00047.

OEM
 0.85915492958 / 0.00047 = 1,827.98921187234

MAX
0.90524290524 / 0.00047 = 1,926.04873455319

The Hurricane 6662 (Code Name: Erin) is the first turbocharger in our Hurricane series. Our Hurricane Series turbochargers focus on packing our highest flowing compressor and turbine wheels into a compact unit for vehicles with space constraint issues that need big airflow to meet their horespower goals. The 6662 utilizes a 66mm compressor wheel within a traditional 60 series compressor cover. This uniquely packaged compressor configuration is married with the largest T3 turbine available from Turbonetics (F1-62) to provide 500 to 600 HP worth of air and large pressure ratio potential in an extremely flexible package. This turbo is ideal for all out power 4 cylinders and most 6 cylinder and smaller displacement 8 cylinder engines. Available in either a standard beaing or Turbonetics patented ceramic ball bearing configuration.


The T-66 included pressure map is moving into the area that if you want to get into the 600 HP level that it is capable of producing your motor is going to probably at least need better pistons at a minimum. Still this turbo looks pretty responsive down at the 8 lbs. of boost so might be one to consider if you are going to do mods to your motor down the road and want a turbo that can keep up with them. Start with one of their smaller turbines and go larger later on the turbine side or if you are staying street get one of the Hurricane Series with the HP-66 Compressor. A little less flow than the T-66 but still should be a very nice turbo in the 500 HP range.
